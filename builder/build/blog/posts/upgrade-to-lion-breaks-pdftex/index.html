     <h1>Upgrade to Lion Breaks pdflatex</h1>
<p>Normally, I write tests and quizzes in LaTeX. I edit the files in MacVim.  Periodically, I need to compile my .tex file and look at the resulting PDF.  This is repetitive and can involve a lot of typing, so in my vimrc, I remapped the <F5> key to run pdflatex on the current file. It looked like this: </p>
<pre><code> noremap &lt;F5&gt; :! pdflatex %&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After making that change to my vimrc, pressing <F5> produces a pdf of the current file. Or at least it did until I upgraded to Lion. When I issued the command after the upgrade (either by pressing <F5> or issuing it in command mode), I received the following message: </p>
<pre><code> /bin/bash: pdflatex: command not found shell returned 127
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently, at some point in the Lion upgrade process, all of my TeX related files got moved from their default location on my executable path (I think they used to be in /usr/bin/texlive or something like that). As a result, my shell could not find the binary to execute. I ended up finding the files I needed located at the following path on my machine: <code>/usr/texbin/</code> </p>
<p>This is where all the goodies for TeX are now stored, and I don't think I remember seeing that directory prior to the upgrade.  At any rate, if you're having this problem, here is a fix for you.  Change your remapping in the vimrc file to the following:</p>
<pre><code> noremap &lt;F5&gt; :! /usr/texbin/pdflatex %&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You could also issue the command from inside MacVim as </p>
<pre><code> :! /usr/texbin/pdflatex %
</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!  I'm sure that I could have added this directory to my executable path and everything would have worked out fine.  However, I couldn't really remember all the ways to set your $PATH variable and didn't have time to look it up.  This worked as a quick solution.  Hope it helps someone.</p>
